## üöÄ Deploy with One Click

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/xi-rick/captains-log)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** : Install the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) .

2. **MongoDB Atlas** : Set up a cloud-based MongoDB database with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) .

3. **Google Cloud Console** : Set up Google OAuth credentials for authentication.

4. **OpenAI API** : Obtain an API key for transcription services.

### Development

You need to pass an env. variable with the MongoDB connection string, as well as any variables required by `next-auth`:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
MONGO_URI=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ALLOWED_EMAIL=
```

How to get these variables?

---

- [`MONGO_URI`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)

The connection string looks something like this:

`mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.<org>.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

In your cluster, click **Connect**:

Under the **Connect your application** section, click **Drivers**:

Click the Copy button next to the connection string:

Replace `<password>` with the password for your user. Ensure any option params are [URL encoded](https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/atlas-url-encoding).

---

- [`GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`](https://developers.google.com/identity/oauth2/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid)

---

### Set Up NEXTAUTH_URL

When deploying to production, set the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to the canonical URL of your site.

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://example.com
```

If you're running locally, set it to http://localhost:3000

### Set Up NEXTAUTH_SECRET

1. Run the following command to generate a random secret and automatically add it to your .env.local file:

```bash
npx auth secret
```

### Set Up OpenAI API

1. Sign up for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) .

2. Obtain your API key from the OpenAI dashboard.

3. Add the key to `.env.local`:

4. Add a few dollars to your OpenAI account. And I do mean like 5.

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Configure Allowed Email

Restrict access to specific email addresses:

```plaintext
ALLOWED_EMAIL=allowed@example.com
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
